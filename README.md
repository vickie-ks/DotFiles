# DotFiles

Welcome to **DotFiles**, a repository I created for my personal use to simplify the setup of a **Cybersecurity Red Team Lab Environment**. It contains scripts to automate user creation and configure the environment, enabling immediate focus on red teaming activities.

If you find this repository useful, feel free to make use of it.
